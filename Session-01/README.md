## Session 1: Introduction to GenAI and Prompt Engineering

**Agenda:** 
- **Presentation**
  - **Generative AI and Azure OpenAI Basics:** What are large language models and how we can use them via Azure OpenAI. Setting up the development environment and Semantic Kernel overview.
  - **Semantic Kernel Overview:** Understanding Semantic Kernel’s purpose and how it connects AI models with code ([Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)).
  - **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals:** What is prompt engineering and why it matters ([Prompt engineering techniques](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering)). Crafting effective prompts (dos and don’ts, best practices).
- **Labs**
  - **Lab 1:** Using the REST Client to send a prompt to Azure OpenAI and observe the output.
  - **Lab 2:** Prompt Engineering Best Practices: Tips to refine prompts for better results (specificity, context, examples, etc.).
  - **Lab 3:** Creating a simple Python script with Semantic Kernel to call an LLM and experimenting with prompt improvements.
- **Wrap up:** QnA, Discussion, Knowledge checks.
